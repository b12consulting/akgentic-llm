class EventMessage(Protocol):
    """Structural type for the envelope that carries a persisted event payload.

    Not a base class and not an event: it describes the *wrapper* the event
    store yields, whose ``.event`` holds the payload. Declared here rather than
    imported because ``akgentic-llm`` must not depend on ``akgentic-core``,
    which owns the concrete envelope (module boundary rule).

    ``event`` is typed ``object``, not a union of this module's events, and that
    width is deliberate. ``restore_context`` is handed a team's **entire** event
    stream, so the payload is routinely one this package has never heard of —
    emitted by core, team or tool. Narrowing it to the LLM events would describe
    a stream that does not exist and would make every non-LLM payload a type
    error at the call site. Consumers narrow with ``isinstance`` instead.

    The *element* type is not similarly defensive: every element really is an
    envelope. ``akgentic.core``'s ``Akgent.init_llm_context`` already declares
    ``list[EventMessage]``, and the sole production caller
    (``akgentic-team``'s restorer) filters to ``EventMessage`` instances before
    handing the list over. Replay therefore reads ``.event`` directly — the
    ``hasattr`` guards it used to carry were an artefact of the older
    ``list[Any]`` signature, not a contract any caller relies on.
