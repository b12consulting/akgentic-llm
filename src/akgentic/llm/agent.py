                  what compaction folded away.
                - The framework does not re-run its orphan role=tool fold after
                  capabilities run. A capability that reintroduces one (e.g. by

        ``LlmContextClearedEvent`` resets the accumulator to empty (**without**
        notify). Non-matching events (e.g. ``ToolCallEvent``, arbitrary objects)
